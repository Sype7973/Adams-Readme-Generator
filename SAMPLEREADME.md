# Sample Readme Generator
  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
  ## Description
  
  My application is a readme.md generator that takes a user's input and pre-populates a preformatted Readme.md file. My motivation for this project was to use inquirer and node.js to create an application that only uses the terminal command
  
  ## Table of Contents (Optional)
  
  If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

  ## Installation
  
  You can start using my readme generator by first installing my repo and ensuring you have node.js and the ability to install inquirier 8.2.4
  
  ## Usage
  
  You can use my application by opening up an integrated terminal from the index.js page and running 'node index.js' you will then be asked a few questions to fill out which will be the text placed into your pre-formatted readme.md file
  
  To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
  
      md
      ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

  List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
  
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
