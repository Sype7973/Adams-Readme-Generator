# My Readme Generator!
  ## Description
  
  - My application is a readme.md generator that takes a user's input and pre-populates a preformatted Readme.md file.
  - My motivation for this project was to use inquirer and node.js to create an application that only uses the terminal command
  - I wanted to take the skills I learn't from this weeks classes and apply them to a terminal driven application. I learn't that back-end can be forgiving but also takes more time to get right.

  ## Installation
  
  You can start using my readme generator by first installing my repo and ensuring you have node.js and the ability to install inquirier 8.2.4
  
  ## Usage
  
  You can use my application by opening up an integrated terminal from the index.js page and running 'node index.js' you will then be asked a few questions to fill out which will be the text placed into your pre-formatted readme.md file.

  Here is a video to how the application works:
